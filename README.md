# This is the last AOC repo that I make

I have a lot of AOC repositories I have to stop this--this is the last one.

## Convention

1. Every year one language
2. Every year one directory
3. Every year as far as I come
4. The inputs in `<year>/inputs/<input id>.txt`
5. Test inputs with `<year>/inputs/t<input id>.txt`
6. One lib folder (don't do everything 15 time or copy the code over share code like a real
   programmer)

## Docu

### 2025

I will come back to Ocaml in 2025 I have programmed a lot of rust and go this year I want to change
things up in this fun event. I want to keep the list of languages that I use as short as possible
because I tent to use to much and be good but not great at everything.
Also I play with the idea of writing my master thesis about something in the Ocaml space and
compilers lets see.
